# Node.js & Express.js Core Project

Welcome to the **Node.js & Express.js Core** repository! This project serves as a foundational template for building web applications using Node.js and Express.js. It demonstrates a modular structure with organized routes, controllers, middleware, and static assets, providing a solid starting point for scalable web development.

## 🧠 Project Objective

This project aims to provide:

- A clear and organized structure for Node.js and Express.js applications.
- Demonstrations of routing, middleware usage, and static file serving.
- A foundation for building RESTful APIs and web applications.
